Hi! I'm Ahmad
a computer science student at the University of Michigan who loves to code, solve complex problems, and collaborate with other people to design projects. 
I am currently pursuing my bachelors of computer science, and in my free time I love playing and creating video games, hanging out with friends, and hitting the gym :)
Feel free to check out my projects!
